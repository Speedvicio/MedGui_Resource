#Persona 2: Eternal Punishment [NTSC-U] (SLUS-01158)
Comment=The only issues with that are that the 2D sprites of the characters are not being 
affected and (typically with Persona games), things that you are not supposed to be able 
to see are being rendered on the sides outside the 4:3 area. Not really a big deal though, 
but if you go to Eyefinity, those issues get nasty.
