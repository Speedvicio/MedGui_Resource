This archive of patches is created to have together all the existing widescreen codes for Playstation.

The codes found in each file are mainly in Gameshark format so they can be used by whatever media 
which can load Gameshark codes.

In some cases they are available also or only in hexadecimal format, with this type of values
is needed an hexadecimal editor like for example the free "HxD", for search in the game image
the original value and replace it with the modified widescreen one.
Using hexadecimal values implies that the game image is modified and then is not needed use
external programs for load codes.

Keep in mind that you can only put in widescreen the games which uses backgrounds or objects
in 3D, either fully or partially, but not those using prerendered or 2D graphics.

The codes are available for the aspect ratio of 16:9 and in some cases for Eyefinity.

Each code should be used exactly for the region and the game ID code described in each case,
otherwise it will not work.

Within each file you can find information about the author of the codes, the region and ID
code, and comments on the game if necessary.

There are patches that needs a render fix (graphics disappear and appear constantly on the sides of the 
screen), for which it has not found a way to correct it.
Other patches can create another small type of graphic problems in games, or they work only partially.
These details are described in the comments of the patch.

From here to thank you very much to all those who have created and shared the widescreen codes.
